  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h4>Hi there. As you already know, my name is Valeria and I'm a User Experience Designer. I love to create useful, accessible, and appealing products for everyday people and always strive to become a better designer. As a UXD I focus on exploring user's goals, needs & behaviors and translating the research insights into creative designs, as well as building perfectly logical and simple structure and architecture.</h4>
